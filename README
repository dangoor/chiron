Chiron
======

Chiron is a system of interoperable JavaScript modules.  Chiron modules
conform to the "securable, interoperable JavaScript module specification" [1].
Chiron also provides a compliant module loader for web browsers.  This
project strives to provide a coherent set of general purpose modules for
both client and server, and secure and non-secured environments.

These modules presently include:

 * a type system
 * base types
 * general-purpose functions
 * events
 * encoding, decoding
 * hashing
 * caching

Versions 0.2 and beyond are being developed here on Github.  The 0.1 development
train is in Subversion at Google Code [2].
